# DFS-Tool

This is a simple Daily Fantasy Sports Tool created in Python with a focus on the NBA. The goal of this project is to work somewhat like a lineup optimizer. Another goal of this project was to be able to create it in Python without Pandas and be able to utilize algorithms to come up with a team. Although this Tool may not be the best, it is still a tool nonetheless.
